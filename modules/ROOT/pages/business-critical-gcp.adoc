:description: Neo4j Aura Cloud Architecture - AuraDB Business Critical on GCP

This diagram illustrates the architecture of Business Critical and Professional running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
It shows how customer connections are routed through shared infrastructure components such as load balancers and Kubernetes nodes, while isolating data.

Use this diagram to understand how Aura is deployed in GCP, how traffic flows from client applications, and how Neo4j maintains availability zones and separation in a shared environment.
