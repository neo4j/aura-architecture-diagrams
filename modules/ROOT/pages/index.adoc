This repository contains Aura architecture diagrams for Virtual Dedicated Cloud (VDC) deployments for each supported cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Additional diagrams show how to connect with each cloud provider's private endpoints (AWS PrivateLink, GCP Private Service Connect, Azure Private Link).
See xref:aura/security/secure-connections/[Secure connections] for more information.

Platform architecture diagrams represent shared infrastructures used in the Professional and Business Critical plans.
