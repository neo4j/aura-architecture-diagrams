This repository contains Aura architecture diagrams for Virtual Dedicated Cloud (VDC) deployments for each supported cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure). 

It also includes diagrams showing how to connect with each cloud provider's private endpoints (AWS PrivateLink, GCP Private Service Connect, Azure Private Link).
See xref:aura/security/secure-connections/[Secure connections] for more information.

In addition, platform architecture diagrams represent shared infrastructure used in the Professional and Business Critical plans.
