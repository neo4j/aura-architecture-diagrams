:description: Neo4j Aura Cloud Architecture - AuraDB Business Critical (Shared) Architecture (Any Cloud)

This diagram shows the architecture for Business Critical and Professional deployments using a shared platform model across supported cloud providers. 
In this diagram, components such as Kubernetes clusters and control plane services are shared across tenants, while customer data and traffic remain isolated.

This diagram expresses how connections are managed, how workloads are distributed, and how Neo4j ensures separation in a shared cloud environment.
