:description: Neo4j Aura Cloud Architecture - AuraDB Business Critical (Shared) Architecture (Any Cloud)

This diagram maps the architecture for Business Critical and Professional deployments on Aura's shared cloud platform.
It shows how key components, such as Kubernetes clusters and control plane services, are shared across tenants, while customer data and traffic stay securely isolated.

You can follow how connections are managed, workloads are balanced, and how Aura maintains strong separation and security within a shared environment across cloud providers.
